Artifical Intelligence(AI)algorithm are sets of rules and computations designed to perform specific tasks without explicit programming. These algorithms enabl machines and system to learn from data.
Here aresome common types of AI algorithms:

1. Supervised Learning Algorithm:
   The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where the input data is paired with corresponding output labels.
   Example:
       * Linear Regression
       * Decision Trees

2. Unsupervised Learning Algorithm:
   The algorithm learns  patterns and relationships within unlabeled data, often used for clustering or dimensionality reduction.
   Example:
       * Q-Learning
       * Deep Q Networks(DQN)

3. Clustering Algorithm:
   Algorithm that group similar data points together based on certain criteria.
   Example: 
       * K-Means
       * Mean Shift

4. Deep Learning Algorithm:
   Neural network architectures with multiple layers(deep neural networks) that excel in learning hierarchical representations.
   Example:
       * Transformer Networks
